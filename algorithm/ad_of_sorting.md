# Advantages And disadvantages of sorting

## 1. Bubble Sort
Advantages | Disadvantages
-- | --
The primary advantage of the bubble sort is that it is popular and easy to implement. | The main disadvantage of the bubble sort is the fact that it does not deal well with a list containing a huge number of items.
In the bubble sort, elements are swapped in place without using additional temporary storage. | The bubble sort requires n-squared processing steps for every n number of elements to be sorted.
The space requirement is at a minimum. | The bubble sort is mostly suitable for academic teaching but not for real-life applications.

## 2. Insertion Sort
Advantages | Disadvantages
-- | --
The main advantage of the insertion sort is its simplicity. | The disadvantage of the insertion sort is that it does not perform as well as other, better sorting algorithms.
It also exhibits a good performance when dealing with a small list. | With n-squared steps required for every n element to be sorted, the insertion sort does not deal well with a huge list.
The insertion sort is an in-place sorting algorithm so the space requirement is minimal. | The insertion sort is particularly useful only when sorting a list of few items.

## 3. Selection Sort
Advantages | Disadvantages
-- | --
The main advantage of the selection sort is that it performs well on a small list. | The primary disadvantage of the selection sort is its poor efficiency when dealing with a huge list of items.
Because it is an in-place sorting algorithm, no additional temporary storage is required beyond what is needed to hold the original list. | The selection sort requires n-squared number of steps for sorting n elements.
Its performance is easily influenced by the initial ordering of the items before the sorting process. | Quick Sort is much more efficient than selection sort.

## 4. Quick Sort
Advantages | Disadvantages
-- | --
The quick sort is regarded as the best sorting algorithm. | The slight disadvantage of quick sort is that its worst-case performance is similar to average performances of the bubble, insertion or selections sorts.
It is able to deal well with a huge list of items. | If the list is already sorted than bubble sort is much more efficient than quick sort
Because it sorts in place, no additional storage is required as well. | If the sorting element is integers than radix sort is more efficient than quick sort.

## 5. Heap sort
Advantages | Disadvantages
-- | --
The Heap sort algorithm is widely used because of its efficiency. | Heap sort requires more space for sorting.
The Heap sort algorithm can be implemented as an in-place sorting algorithm. | Quick sort is much more efficient than Heap in many cases.
Its memory usage is minimal. | Heap sort make a tree of sorting elements.

## 6. Merge Sort
Advantages | Disadvantages
-- | --
It can be applied to files of any size. | Requires extra space Â»N.
Reading of the input during the run-creation step is sequential ==> Not much seeking. | Merge Sort requires more space than other sort.
If heap sort is used for the in-memory part of the merge, its operation can be overlapped with I/O. | Merge sort is less efficient than other sort.
